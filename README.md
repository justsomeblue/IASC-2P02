## About me

My name is Stephanie Csikasz and I am an Interactive Arts and Science major, first year. I started my university career at brock in 2015, and just switched my major last year. My area of interest in digital huminites is in the arts- specifically 3d modeling and animation. My work in digital huminites has always put an emphasis on the artistic side of this major, with strong visuals being an intrinsic part of my work style. I plan to further this in the future by learning how to do animation and 3d art not just 2d still images as I use in my works for this portfolio. While I learn animation, I also plan to strengthen my skills in my current visualization as well, by learning better layouts, colour theory practices, and dynamic artwork to strengthen all projects. With this, I plan to enter the game industry and create assets for videogames. This relates to digital humanities because not only is art an important section of digital humanities, but research in the humanities can be used to further our understanding of how to make art even better, and how to use it effectively in digital spaces. 
## Featured Project

## Collaborative Project
The digital tool Palladio is used to visualize data in various formats. It can be used to show connections inside the data that may not otherwise be obvious and can be interacted with to show data any way the user wants. This project used Palladio to test out how robust and flexible the program is and determine its strengths and weaknesses. The results found Palladio to be a user-friendly tool, through it has a weakness with larger data sets. We produced graphs maps and other forms of data visualization in our project. 

## Academic Blog

It is very easy to see digital humanities as an oxymoron, two mindsets and values that act like oil and water when combined. If you look at the two on their own, this would be correct. I find myself agreeing with some arguments against this from Kirschenbaum, Alvarado, and Ramsay, though my conclusions and reasonings are rather fittingly different from them.
